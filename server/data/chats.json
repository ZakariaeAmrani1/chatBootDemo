He's known for his enthusiasm, optimism, and can-do attitude, which makes him a great role model for kids.\n\nBuilder's catchphrase, \"Can we fix it? Yes, we can!\" has become a rallying cry for many kids (and adults!) who believe in the power of teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving.\n\nWhat do you think about Builder? Do you have a favorite episode or memory featuring this beloved character?",
